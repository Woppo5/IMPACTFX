Simple Image Processing and Customization Tool Effects


When you use the script, it will automatically generate one folder named "INPUT". To process your photos, simply place them into a main "INPUT" folder, run the script, and the processed photos will be saved in the "OUTPUT" folder.


The default image processing settings are:

    Brightness: 0.8
    Contrast: 1.5
    Shadows: 0
    Highlights: 260

You can change these settings when you run the program or in the script.
